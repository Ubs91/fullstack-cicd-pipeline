# Continuous Integration & Deployment Pipeline

This repository implements an automated build and deployment system using **GitHub Actions** to streamline code validation and production releases. The workflow maintains code integrity while enabling seamless delivery to live environments.

---

## ‚ö° Key Capabilities

- **Continuous Integration** validates all pull requests targeting `develop` and `main` branches
- **Automated Production Releases** execute when changes merge to `main`
- **GitHub Actions Integration** orchestrates the entire pipeline
- End-to-end component validation with Cypress
- Multi-directory build processes covering both frontend and backend components

---

## üîç Integration Workflow

Code validation occurs automatically whenever pull requests are opened or modified against protected branches.

### üéØ Activation Triggers:
- Pull requests targeting `develop` branch
- Pull requests targeting `main` branch

### üîß Execution Pipeline:
1. Repository code retrieval
2. Node.js environment configuration
3. Package dependency installation
4. Frontend and backend compilation
5. Cypress component test execution

> All validation checks must succeed before pull request approval is possible.

---

## üì¶ Production Release Process

Live deployment initiates exclusively when validated code merges into the primary branch, ensuring only vetted changes reach end users.

### üéØ Activation Triggers:
- Direct commits to `main` branch

### üîß Release Pipeline:
1. Source code acquisition
2. Runtime environment preparation
3. Dependency resolution and compilation
4. Production environment deployment (via platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS)

> Specific deployment procedures vary based on chosen hosting infrastructure.
