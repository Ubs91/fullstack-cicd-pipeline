# DeploymentChamp

This project uses a CI/CD pipeline powered by **GitHub Actions** to automate testing and deployment workflows. The pipeline ensures code quality and safe deployment to production environments.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Automated Testing** for every pull request to `develop` and `main`
- **Production Deployment** on merges to `main`
- **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**
- Cypress component testing
- Build steps for both `client` and `server` directories

---

## üß™ Testing Workflow

Tests are automatically run when a pull request is created or updated, targeting the `develop` or `main` branches.

### ‚úÖ Triggered on:
- `pull_request` to `develop`
- `pull_request` to `main`

### üìã Steps:
1. Checkout the repository
2. Set up Node.js
3. Install dependencies
4. Build client and server
5. Run Cypress component tests

> Pull requests must pass all tests before they can be merged.

---

## üö¢ Deployment Workflow

Deployment is triggered **only** when code is merged into the `main` branch. This ensures that only reviewed and tested code reaches production.

### ‚úÖ Triggered on:
- `push` to `main`

### üìã Steps:
1. Checkout the code
2. Set up environment
3. Install and build dependencies
4. Deploy to the hosting provider (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS)

> Deployment specifics depend on the platform used.
